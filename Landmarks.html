                    Prasat Hin Phimai is one of the oldest and most significant temples in the country. Built in the
                    11th century, the temple is one of the largest and most impressive examples of Khmer architecture
                    found anywhere in Asia. It is situated in the heart of the Phimai Historical Park, and it is very
                    similar in style to Angkor Wat in Cambodia. The temple complex is surrounded by moats and ancient
                    walls, with several scenic ponds and bridges. Walk through some of the galleries, and you&#146;ll
                    find
                    yourself within the inner sanctuary. Here, you can see a number of beautifully preserved statues.

                    Wat Rong Khun, or the White Temple, is one of the most fascinating and spectacular landmarks in
                    Thailand. Although it looks like it might be ancient, the White Temple was actually only designed in
                    1997 by the artist Chalermchai Kositpipat. The temple is essentially an art installation on a grand
                    scale, featuring countless gates and sculptures. As you enter, crossing over a bridge, hundreds of
                    outstretched hands reach up from the ground. Then, opulent details give the entire area a surreal
                    look. For something unusual and unforgettable, the White Temple fits the bill.

                    There are several wonderful islands in Phang Nga Bay, but none can compare to James Bond Island. The
                    isle is actually called Khao Phing Kan, and it boasts beautiful beaches as well as unique limestone
                    formations and cliffs. Once it was featured in the film The Man With The Golden Gun, Khao Phing Kan
                    became known forevermore as James Bond Island. Many visitors explore the island on a day trip by
                    boat that departs from Phuket. Once you&#146;re there, soak in the scenery, enjoy the beach, but
                    prepare
                    for bigger crowds thanks to the island&#146;s incredible popularity.

                    Sukhothai is a small city, but it was once the capital of Thailand. At the Sukhothai Historical
                    Park, you can see what remains of this ancient city. Most of the structures date back to the 13th
                    and 14th centuries, and they are spread out over several acres. The best way to tour the park is on
                    a rented bicycle, and mornings are the coolest and least busy time to do so. You&#146;ll be able to see
                    temple ruins, large Buddha statues, bridges and more, all surrounded by moats and lakes. Visiting
                    Sukhothai is an incredible opportunity to see a preserved piece of history.

                    Wat Arun, or the Temple of Dawn, is a Buddhist temple found in Bangkok. Built during the reign of
                    King Narai in the 17th century, the Temple of Dawn is a striking structure. At dawn, the very first
                    rays of light in the city strike the temple, creating an iridescent sheen. That&#146;s due to the
                    exterior material, a mixture of porcelain and seashells that reflect the light beautifully. As
                    fantastic as the spire looks from the outside, you can also head inside and climb right up the
                    central prang. From here, you&#146;ll be treated to spectacular views over the Chao Phraya River and
                    even
                    across to Wat Pho, another famed temple in Bangkok.
